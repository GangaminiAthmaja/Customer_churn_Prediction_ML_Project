About:

Tools: Python, Flask, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas



•	Led a Data Mining Project aimed at predicting customer churn using advanced machine learning techniques.



•	Preprocessed data with Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas to ensure readiness for modeling.



•	Built and fine-tuned a machine learning model using Scikit-learn and TensorFlow, optimizing it through rigorous evaluation and validation.



•	Developed a user-friendly web application with Flask, enabling stakeholders to input customer data and receive real-time churn predictions.



•	Seamlessly deployed the model as an interactive tool for continuous monitoring and user engagement.



Key Skills: Machine learning, data preprocessing, Python (NumPy, Pandas), Flask, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn.
